# Packet Filters
# Networks can experience extraneous traffic from outside sources.
# This has been common in the past, so if you find your router instance flooded
# by packets from unknown sources, you can add a filter to block them. Filters
# are disabled by default, but you can turn them on within this file.
# For example, consider the following (commented out) filters:
#
#171.64.15.55/32
#171.64.15.9/31 eth1
#
# The first filter is an IP address and a netmask. If this
# filter is enabled, then sr will automatically drop all packets
# that do not match the filter (i.e. that do not match the prefix
# 171.64.15.55/32). This /32 is one end point, but you can set
# filters like 171.64.0.0/16 or even 171.64.0.0/1.
#
# The second kind of filter, 171.64.15.9/31 eth1, is a filter that
# forcibly injects all *incoming* packets that match the prefix into the
# specified interface. That is, all packets coming from hosts matching
# 171.64.15.9/31 eth1 will be seen to come in from eth1. This is useful for
# testing tricky edge cases. While not necessary in this lab, this kind of
# filter can be very useful in lab5. Note that filters only affect incoming
# packets, not outgoing ones.
